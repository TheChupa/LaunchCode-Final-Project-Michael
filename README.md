# LaunchCode Final Project



Cyber-Audit Version 1.1 featuring AISlop Morpheus

This is a full-stack project made for LaunchCode.


This website is intended to be a simulation of what could occur when a user's information is lost/sold/stolen. A side effect can include a user realizing that many of the attack vectors are given away freely to e-commerce, Social Media, Financial, and Government websites. The goal is to increase awareness and prevent users from becoming willing victims of cybercrime.

Includes an "admin" view to provide more context on how much user data IS worth.




This project is built with:

To install and use this:

Back-end will need you to update a few things. In the application.properties folder, there are several variables that will need to be set.

DB_HOST = Database hostname
DB_PORT = Database port number
DB_NAME = Name of Database in MySQL
DB_USER = username of the account to access MySQL
DB_PASS = username password


You will also need to request a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and set it up in the back-end. This is required for the website to function as intended.
